John Venkiah | Musician

Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to give my own artist website, a completely new design, both for the purpose of gaining a new website that is beautiful, responsive and updated, but also as means of projecting what I have learnt so far concerning HTML and CSS. In this website, users can listen to or buy my music, watch videos, learn more about me, sign up for a newsletter or contact me.

Here is the link to the deployed website: https://johnvenkiah.github.io/CI_MS1_John_Venkiah/

User Goals

The design and content should ultimately invite users to want to book me as a musician, buy my music or follow me on social media. Users should be able to navigate easily, feeling a visual consistency throughout the whole website. The main element on that specific page should be clear, and the most important navigational links should be visible from everywhere, in the same place.

Users using screen readers should also be able to feel welcome thanks to correct arla-labelling and alt attributes for images.

Design choices

As I have just released a new album, with cover-art that I am fond of, I thought that I should be inspired by that design. I found free fonts that were as similar as possible to the fonts used (due to copyright could not use the same ones) and color-coded active text with the same orange color as on the cover. I also added a black background and consistent white text, as I like dark themes in general.

PICTURE OF FONTS

I also thought that good images that cover the whole background make a big impact on users, so I chose images that I like, with different ones on each page. This also make the users aware of the page they are on.

A navigation bar at the top is visible and fixed on all pages, which includes the website name at the top left, and Home, Listen, Videos, Bio and Get in Touch links.

On the right hand side, there are icons with links to Spotify, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

Text or icons that is hovered over has a darker shade of orange than pages that are active, or the submit button, which insinuates that the links are clickable.

I also used a translucent grey for mid-level elements to create a feeling of three-dimensionality and transparence.

(Images with colours and elements)

I also used easily recognisable icons from Font Awesome for social media and music service-links that follow the same color scheme.

Structure

The website structure is basic, where the header, footer and social media navigational bars are always visible, and the main content of the page navigated to is central.

Home - The main content is the new album, almost in the middle, with a short description urging the user to listen to my new album

Listen - Here, the main content is a scrollable element containing embedded web-players of different albums or playlists with my music. Below each one are four icons, to my music on different music services.

Videos - Several embedded videos from YouTube fill out the main content of this page, with live concerts and music videos that I have been a part of.

Get in touch - This is a web form in which users can enter their name, email, a message and subscribe to a newsletter.
