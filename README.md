### John Venkiah | Musician

![Mockup for John Venkiah's Artist Website](assets/docs/mockup/mockup_2)

Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to give my own artist website, a completely new design, both for the purpose of gaining a new website that is beautiful, responsive and updated, but also as means of projecting what I have learnt so far concerning HTML and CSS. In this website, users can listen to or buy my music, watch videos, learn more about me, sign up for a newsletter or contact me.

Here is the link to the deployed website: https://johnvenkiah.github.io/CI_MS1_John_Venkiah/

User Goals

The design and content should ultimately invite users to want to book me as a musician, buy my music or follow me on social media. Users should be able to navigate easily, feeling a visual consistency throughout the whole website. The main element on that specific page should be clear, and the most important navigational links should be visible from everywhere, in the same place.

Users using screen readers should also be able to feel welcome thanks to correct arla-labelling and alt attributes for images.

Design choices

As I have just released a new album, with cover-art that I am fond of, I thought that I should be inspired by that design. I found free fonts that were as similar as possible to the fonts used (due to copyright could not use the same ones) and color-coded active text with the same orange color as on the cover. I also added a black background and consistent white text, as I like dark themes in general.

PICTURE OF FONTS

I also thought that good images that cover the whole background make a big impact on users, so I chose images that I like, with different ones on each page. This also make the users aware of the page they are on.

A navigation bar at the top is visible and fixed on all pages, which includes the website name at the top left, and Home, Listen, Videos, Bio and Get in Touch links.

On the right hand side, there are icons with links to Spotify, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

Text or icons that is hovered over has a darker shade of orange than pages that are active, or the submit button, which insinuates that the links are clickable.

I also used a translucent grey for mid-level elements to create a feeling of three-dimensionality and transparence.

(Images with colours and elements)

I also used easily recognisable icons from Font Awesome for social media and music service-links that follow the same color scheme.

Structure

The website structure is basic, where the header, footer and social media navigational bars are always visible, and the main content of the page navigated to is central.

Home - The main content is the new album, almost in the middle, with a short description urging the user to listen to my new album

Listen - Here, the main content is a scrollable element containing embedded web-players of different albums or playlists with my music. Below each one are four icons, to my music on different music services.

Videos - Several embedded videos from YouTube fill out the main content of this page, with live concerts and music videos that I have been a part of.

Get in touch - This is a web form in which users can enter their name, email, a message and subscribe to a newsletter.

Wireframes

I created wireframes for the five different pages, for smartphone, tablet and computer screens, you can view them here.

- Add pictures of wireframes to this section -

I picture the website as part mini-gallery, so the different pages also are pro photographs, as this also gives an artistic impression.

After making my wireframes, I came to the conclusion that I wanted each page to be a full photo, with a indicator urging the user to scroll down to the page content, which I found more appealing visually.

I also later decided to use a menu bar for small screens, as a hamburger icon is so widely used and also to make use of CSS as much as possible.

The main logo retains the full width of the screen on all pages.

Home

Here, it is clear what the focus is - my new album. No other main content is visible, but all the menu elements are there, both social media and website navigation. A nice colourful picture fills the rest of the screen.

The idea is the same on tablet and smartphone, and due to the single hero image of the cd cover, the home page doesn't get crowded. A menu icon to the top right, which I eventually removed from the design.

Listen

Here is a grid filled with links to music you can listen to both right there in the window but also whole albums or singles that are links to listen to on the preferred media. The grid should also contain short info about the music.

For smaller screens, the grid of music is resized to fit smaller screens, and has one element per row. The user can see the social media icons upon loading and at the very bottom of the page.

Videos

Here, users can watch carefully chosen videos with my music.
I wanted the user to see a full screen video as soon as they click the videos link, if watching on a large screen, while the video aspect ratio remains the same. This means that when using a smaller screen, thte user sees several videos when scrolling, which is what I was after.

Bio

I later renamed this page About, which I preferred. Here is basic info about my life as a musician and background. Also, some images nicely placed within the content.

Get in Touch

I renamed this page "Contact", both due to that Get in touch didn't look as good in the nav bar, but also because "Get in Touch" is widely used for this purpose.

On this page, I put a simple form, where users can enter their name, email address, write a short message and sign up for newsletters. Here is also links to my press material for bookings, etc.

On large screens, the form will take up one side of the page while there is an image on the other. On smartphone screens, the form will fill the whole page.
